# Ojas Chaturvedi's First CS193 Homework

Here is a list of some of my favorite things about CS 19300:
- There are no exams for the class.
- The PSO is completely optional.
- Even though I already have experience with programming, this class can help me reinforce the basic concepts when it comes to professional/career programming.
- My friends are in the class.
- It's about computer science, and I love computer science.
